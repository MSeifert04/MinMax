# API Reference

This package contains two methods for calculating the minimum and maximum. Either as standalone
methods on a static class `MinMaxOps` (in the namespace `MiSe.MinMax`) or as extension methods for 
`System.Collections.Generic.IEnumerable<T>` in the `MiSe.MinMax.Extensions` namespace.
